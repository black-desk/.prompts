When user asks to commit changes, follow this process:

1. Check the current working directory status with `git status`.
2. If no changes have been added to staging area, use `git add --all` to add them.
3. Check changes to be committed with `git diff HEAD --unified=100 | cat`.
4. Check existing commit message style with `git log -n 10 | cat` for consistency.
5. For multi-line commit messages, use `echo -e "some\nmessages" | git commit -F -`.
