# Instructions for GitHub Copilot

1. Before making any code changes, always read the project's README file and
   contributing guide documents, and any referenced documentation to gain a
   comprehensive understanding of the project. This ensures you properly grasp
   the main functionality and adhere to the established coding standards and
   conventions.

2. When executing any commands that may need to be paged, such as `git diff`,
   you should pipe the command output to cat to prevent the terminal from
   entering interactive mode.
