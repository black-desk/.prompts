Before starting any task,
thoroughly review the project's README file,
contribution guidelines (e.g., CONTRIBUTING.md),
and any referenced documents within those files.
This ensures a comprehensive understanding of the project,
enabling you to accurately grasp its core functionality
and adhere to established coding standards and conventions.

When executing commands that may trigger pagination,
always pipe the output to `cat` (e.g., `git diff | cat`)
to prevent the terminal from entering interactive mode,
which could interrupt automated processes.
