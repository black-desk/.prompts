# Instructions for GitHub Copilot

1. Before proceeding with any task,
   always thoroughly review the project's README file,
   contribution guidelines,
   and any referenced documentation
   to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project.
   This approach ensures you accurately grasp the core functionality
   and properly adhere to established coding standards and conventions.

2. When executing commands that may trigger pagination,
   such as `git diff`,
   always pipe the output to `cat` (e.g., `git diff | cat`)
   to prevent the terminal from entering interactive mode,
   which could interrupt automated processes.
