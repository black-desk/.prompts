# Contributing Guide

1. All documentation, comments and commit messages
   must be written in English.

2. Follow [Semantic Line Breaks][sembr] principles in your writing:

   > When writing text with a compatible markup language,
   > add a line break after each substantial unit of thought.

3. Respect the code style defined by existing linter configuration files,
   for example .editorconfig, in the project.

4. Adhere to the [Conventional Commits 1.0][conventional-commits] specification
   when crafting commit messages.
