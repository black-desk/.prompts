1. Use git commands to determine the actual project name and repository location.
2. Read all files in the project. Look for strings that need to be replaced, such as "template", "YOUR NAME", and other obvious placeholder text. Replace them with the actual project name.
3. Check TODOs in the project and ensure you have completed all TODOs related to the project name.
